# **CONNECT TO POSTGRESQL DATABASE**

Since I am using VS Code let's start by installing the SQLTools extension and SQLTools PostgreSQL/Cockroach Driver extension.

After installing the extension we need to **Add New Connection**. Here's the info needed:
  - Connection name
  - Server name: in my case localhost  
  - Port
  - Database: chinook for this project purpose 
  - username and password
